Certainly! Below is a simple HTML page code that displays a "Hello World" heading:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- `<html lang="en">`: The root element of the HTML document, specifying the language as English.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document, such as character set and viewport settings.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the document.
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures the page is responsive and scales properly on different devices.
- `<title>Hello World Page</title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the HTML document.
- `<h1>Hello World</h1>`: A heading element that displays "Hello World" as the main heading of the page.

You can copy and paste this code into a `.html` file and open it in a web browser to see the "Hello World" heading.
